# PIG_THE_GAME

## Overview

The Dice Game is a simple text-based game designed for 2 to 4 players. The goal is to be the first player to reach a total score of 50. Players take turns rolling a die and accumulate points based on the result of the roll. Rolling a 1 ends the turn with no points added for that turn. The game continues until a player reaches or exceeds the target score.
